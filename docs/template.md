## Using the blocks
It is one of the most amaizing way to add blocks by using drag and drop functionality. To use the plugin, follow these steps.
<ul class="task-list">
    <li class="task-list-item">
        <input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="">
        Navigate to <b>Post</b> or <b>Posts</b> and open the <b>Editor</b>.
    </li>
    <li class="task-list-item">
        <input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="">
        When you open the Editor click on <b>+</b> button to add new blocks
    </li>
    <li class="task-list-item">
        <input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="">
        Search <b>CM</b> to display all our Cm Blocks or Scroll to our <b>Codemanas Blocks</b>.
    </li>
</ul>

## Choose a Template
All of our blocks become available as soon as a block is successfully inserted. Thus, each block has two options when adding it for the first time. One option is to select one of the available templates, and another is to start creating the blocks from scratch. For every block, we have more than four beautiful patterns available.

## Available Blocks
The big bundle of blocks will be called CM Blocks. But as of right now, our collection consists of 7 blocks. They are:
<ul>
    <li>CM Accordion</li>
    <li>CM Slider</li>
    <li>CM Counter</li>
    <li>CM Countdown</li>
    <li>CM Masonry Gallery</li>
    <li>CM Tabs</li>
    <li>CM Progress Bar</li>
</ul>
