## Using the blocks
Blocks is an effective way to add blocks by using drag and drop functionality. To use the plugin, follow these steps.
<ul class="task-list">
    <li class="task-list-item">
        <input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="">
        Navigate to <b>Post</b> or <b>Posts</b> and open the <b>Editor</b>.
    </li>
    <li class="task-list-item">
        <input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="">
        When you open the Editor click on <b>+</b> button to add new blocks
    </li>
    <li class="task-list-item">
        <input type="checkbox" disabled="" checked="">
        Search <b>CM</b> to display all our Cm Blocks or Scroll to our <b>Codemanas Blocks</b>.
    </li>
</ul>

## Choose a Template
All of our blocks become available for use as you add your first block. Each block has two options when adding it for the first time. First option is to select one of the available templates, and second is to start creating the blocks from scratch. For every block, you can choose from a wide selection of over four design patterns.
