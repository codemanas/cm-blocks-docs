Kits is a collection of themes that offers a wide range of categories, each containing multiple template pages. Preview images can be selected to view the detailed design of individual template pages, or a comprehensive demo of the entire theme category can be accessed. Once a preferred design is chosen, the template pages can be  imported. This process makes it straightforward to explore, preview, and use templates in websites.
