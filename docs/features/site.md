##Difference between Coming Soon and Maintenance mode
The difference between coming soon mode and maintenance mode is the http status code that is returned.
Coming Soon Mode.
Coming Soon Mode returns 200 OK as the status code this indicates to search engines(like google) that this is a valid page.
Maintenance Mode returns 503 OK as the status code that indicates to search engines(like google) that the service is currently unavailable and instructs them to check back later.

##Coming Soon Mode
Enable Coming Soon Mode, and Option will be shown to select a coming soon page.
Any visitor that visits the site will be shown the page you selected and will not be able to navigate other content.

P.S. : You can create a page and use the CM Blocks Design Library to quickly import a template or
make one yourself.

##Maintenance Mode
Enable Maintenance Mode, and Option will be shown to select a maintenance mode page.
Any visitor that visits the site will be shown the maintenance mode page instead of any page or url of the site that they entered.
